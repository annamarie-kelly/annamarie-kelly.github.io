											<h3>My Internship Experience</h3>

											<p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Hippo Insurance as a Software
												Engineering Intern within the Partner API team. Unlike many internship experiences where
												interns work on low-risk, isolated projects, I was tasked with an impactful project and treated
												like a full-time employee. The skills I have gained and the knowledge I am taking away are
												immeasurable.</p>
											
											<p><h4>
												Academia vs. Coding in the Real World
											</h4>
												Within my academic career, I&#39;ve only had well defined, isolated problems:
												every test, assignment, and problem set always came filled with everything necessary to find the
												solution. While working at Hippo, this was rarely the case. I realized that although requirements
												were known (I.e., &quot;acceptance criteria&quot;), it was up to me to investigate the complex problems
												embedded in loads of context. I learned to gather relevant information to analyze possible
												solutions and deduce the one best suited for the problem.</p>
											<p><h4>
												From &quot;Coder&quot; to Software Developer
											</h4>
												Most of my studies at University have focused entirely on programming languages and analyzing
												algorithms. I rarely contemplated abstract solutions to a problem before touching code. Working
												as a Software Engineering Intern extended my process to actively think about what I am doing,
												what I want to create, and how I will make it happen. </p>
											<p>
												My time at Hippo also broadened my understanding of what the job of a Software Developer
												entails. Aside from writing new code, I was in charge of fixing bugs, design and architecture,
												testing, and refactoring.</p>
											<p><h4>
												Developing an End-to-End Solution
											</h4>
												My primary project during my internship was to design a high-level API that implements
												business logic to interact with our Data Vendors. I learned to write a formal Tech Design
												Document that detailed information like the scope of the problem, the analysis of possible
												solutions, and my recommendation for the best course of action. I attended brainstorms and
												reviews to gather information and feedback that helped me clarify and reiterate my ideas. I also
												learned to make data models and sequence diagrams to explain my solutions better. </p>
											<p>
												I then used that document to break down tasks into manageable Jira tickets and estimate each
												ticket&#39;s story points. These tickets helped me prioritize what needed to be done and kept me from
												getting overwhelmed at the size of the project.</p>
											<p>
												Coding the actual API brought fun, new challenges. I was working in a language and framework
												I did not know before this experience. It was also my first time working with Git, and it took me
												a while to get the hang of the pull request (PR) process: In the first few weeks, I regularly failed
												CircleCi tests from forgetting to update test snapshots and having lint errors. I was very excited
												to learn there were commands to fix these before pushing the PRs.</p>
											<p>
												After building the API, the next challenge was to figure out how to test it. I wrote thorough unit
												and translation tests by mocking services to test the logic of my code. I also used monitoring
												metrics to track latency and data miss through HTTP responses.</p>
											<p>
												After ensuring everything worked properly, I integrated this API within a data vendor, which
												brought the challenge of navigating legacy code. I learned to write integration and regression
												tests. My implementation resulted in a change in underwriting rules. As a result, I also wrote a
												migration script to modify existing policies to follow the new rules.</p>
											<p>
												In the final week of my internship, my API integration went into production! My team and I
												worked late to assist DevOps with any hiccups surrounding the code release. It is exciting to
												know that something I worked so hard on is being used by customers every day!</p>
											<p><h4>
												Experiencing Growth and Mentorship
											</h4>
												At the beginning of my internship, I was paired with a mentor to help me become accustomed to
												the code base and help me along the way. My mentor, Edward, was a friendly face right from the
												start, and the connection was a resource to ask any questions I had. He offered insight into the
												company and the technologies it used. He also gave advice about career development and finding
												a work-life balance. It was a wonderful experience working with such a talented engineer.</p>
											<p>
												As my internship progressed, I had the opportunity to interact with the other Senior Engineers on
												the Partner API team. They gave technical advice surrounding caching/persistence logic, object-
												oriented design patterns, and the tradeoffs between synchronous vs. asynchronous flow. This
												team helped me grow as a developer by giving critical feedback in code and design reviews. </p>
											<p><h4>
												A Thank You</h4>
												This summer, I saw firsthand the kind of innovative spirit that compelled me to join the tech
												industry in the first place. I could not have asked for a better internship experience to build a
												foundation for my career. I will forever be thankful for this opportunity and proud to be a part of
												the Hippo family.
