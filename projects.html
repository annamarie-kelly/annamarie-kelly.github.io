                                        <p>• Developed a full stack application that finds affordable, “good”  wine based on a user’s preferred flavor profile. I utilize preferences, price range, and various wine ranking systems to web scrape wine-searcher.com and vivino.com to pair the user with wines they will love. <br>
                                           • Generate a downloadable and shareable personalized list of wines and their information (name, vintage, price point, and link to purchase ).

                                        <p><h4>Something New:</h4>
                                            This project was the first time I integrated a personal passion into a project. I love wine, yet every time I went to a grocery store I got overwhelmed with the selection size and didn’t know which to buy. I grew tired of researching every intriguing label from unfamiliar wines. So why not use my skills to solve this problem? 
                                            I taught myself to web scrape from youtube tutorials and successfully developed a full-stack application to find good wine.

                                        <h2>Maze Solver</h2>
                                        <p>C++</p>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>• Wrote a depth-first algorithm that randomly generates and solves a maze of arbitrary size. I animate the
                                    process through a GUI that allows users to choose the width and height of the maze. </p>

                                    <p><h4>A Humbling Experience:
                                    </h4>
                                    This was my favorite project in C++ and the project that helped my mastery of the language. The language was unforgiving and I spent more time fixing memory leaks than writing the logic for the maze solver/generator. Prior to this project, I felt confident that I was “good” at writing code because once I figured out how to approach it, nothing could stop me. Yet C++ is the only language that made me pause and question whether or not I was correctly solving a problem. It taught me to slow down to consider all of the complex moving parts.

                                    </header>
                                    <p>• Coded a fully customizable Sudoku game that validates user moves, gives hints, and exports board solutions. Has an AI feature that uses first-depth search algorithm to solve any imported Sudoku board.<br> 
                                        • Utilized register conventions, epilogues/prologues, and stack pointers to write readable,  efficient assembly code.<br>

                                    <p><h4>Leveling Up:</h4>
                                        This was my first large project in an Assembly language. Working in a low-level language was a difficult and rewarding experience. MIPS forced me to slow down and think not just about game mechanics but also important backend details such as memory management. I had to properly manipulate bits and manage registrars and memory bocks in an organized manner. This project taught me the importance of comments and code documentation. My struggles from this project gave me a greater appreciation for higher-level languages.

                                <p>• Created a metric to analyze the lexical similarity of imported texts. I utilized the Levenshtien Distance to
                                    measure similarities between individual words and whole sentences within documents and return a
                                    formatted document of all seemingly “plagiarized” lines.</p>

                                This was the first project I did that was not an arcade game. Before this project, I thought I would not enjoy coding anything other than a game but I enjoyed it the same amount! It opened my eyes to the possibilities of what I could make.

                                    <p>• Improved my graphic skills by replicating PacMan.<br>
                                        • Designed UML class diagrams which helped me create robust, scalable code that is flexible with different sets of payouts and rules.

                                        This is my favorite project I have done in Java. It was the first project where I felt I truly mastered both graphics and gameplay. 
                                        I was successful because I spent the time to thoroughly plan the classes and desired UI before touching any code.

                                    <p>• Recreated the classic Tetris game. I researched and implemented the rules, according to

                                        • This was the first project I did that used many abstracted, interrelated classes and methods.

                                        This was the project where I fell in love with coding. Ever since I was young I loved arcade games and after learning a bit of Java I wanted to recreate one of my favorite games. While the graphics were awful, I felt such excitement bringing something I love so much to life. I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life and have followed that spark ever since.
